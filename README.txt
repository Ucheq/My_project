MY FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO:

This is a portfolio website showcasing my frontend development skills and projects. It serves
as a platform to introduce myself, display my contact information, highlight my portfolio of
projects, and provide a home section for general information.
==================================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTIONS:

Home
The "Home" section is the landing page of the website. It serves as a welcome page, providing 
a brief overview of what visitors can expect to find on the site. It may also include a visually 
appealing design element or background image to create an engaging first impression.

About Me:
In the "About Me" section, you will find a brief introduction to who I am as a frontend 
developer. It includes information about my background, education, and relevant skills. 
I aim to give visitors a glimpse into my passion for web development and my commitment to 
creating user-friendly and visually appealing experiences.

Portfolio
The "Portfolio" section showcases a selection of my best frontend projects. Each project 
is accompanied by a description, key features, technologies used, and a link to view the 
project live. I believe this section will demonstrate my proficiency in front-end development
and give visitors an idea of my capabilities.

Contact
The "Contact" section provides various ways to get in touch with me. You will find my email 
address, phone number, and links to my social media profiles. Feel free to reach out if you 
have any inquiries, collaboration opportunities, or simply want to connect.
